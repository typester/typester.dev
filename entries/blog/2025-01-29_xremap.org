I had been looking for a remapper that allows changing key mappings *per application* on Wayland, but I struggled to find a good one.

Recently, I happened to come across [[https://github.com/xremap/xremap][Xremap]] again and decided to reread its README. I had known about this tool for a long time, but I remember it being written in Python back then and lacking Wayland support. However, it is now written in Rust and supports Wayland. It also seemed to support everything I wanted to achieve.

So, I decided to give it a try.

* Installation

I use Arch Linux with [[https://isaacfreund.com/software/river/][river]].

Since river is a wlroots-based window manager, I installed the following:

#+begin_src sh
  ‚ùØ paru -S xremap-wlroots-bin
#+end_src

* Configuration

Add the user to the input group and set up a udev rule.

#+begin_src sh
  ‚ùØ sudo usermod -a -G input $USER
  ‚ùØ echo 'KERNEL=="uinput", GROUP="input", TAG+="uaccess"' | sudo tee /etc/udev/rules.d/99-input.rules
#+end_src

Then, restart the system.

* Remapping Configuration

Here‚Äôs what I wanted to achieve with this tool:

- Use the Space key as Shift when held but as Space when pressed alone.
  - Disable this functionality for specific applications (mainly games).
- Adjust key mappings for each keyboard hardware.

The following configuration meets these requirements:

#+begin_src yaml
  shared:
    games: &games
      - steam_app_default  # DiabloIV
      - steam_app_2694490  # POE2

  modmap:
    - name: SandS
      application:
        not: *games
      remap:
        Space:
          held: Shift_L
          alone: Space
          alone_timeout_millis: 999999999

    - name: HHKB
      device:
        only: "Topre Corporation HHKB Professional"
      remap:
        KEY_GRAVE: KEY_ESC
        KEY_ESC: KEY_GRAVE
        KEY_BACKSLASH: KEY_BACKSPACE
        KEY_BACKSPACE: KEY_BACKSLASH
#+end_src

The startup command is set in the river configuration:

#+begin_src sh
  xremap ~/.config/xremap/config.yaml --watch=config,device &
#+end_src

This is how I start it.

** Unclear Aspects

1. The =alone_timeout_millis= setting
2. How to specify applications
3. The =watch= command-line option

*** The =alone_timeout_millis= Setting

I wanted to disable this timeout, so I initially set it to =0=. However, this caused the Space key to no longer function as Space when pressed aloneüòÇ
I can‚Äôt imagine anyone wanting that behavior, so it didn‚Äôt make sense at all. For now, I decided to set it to a sufficiently large value.

*** How to Specify Applications

The documentation includes an example for Sway, but there was no description of how to specify applications in general wlroots-based WMs. I wasn‚Äôt sure what to use at the first glance.
After some experimentation, I found that specifying the =app_id= retrieved from =lswt= seems to work.

*** The =watch= Command-Line Option

Initially, I simply specified =--watch=, but it didn‚Äôt seem to enable automatic config reloading.  
It appears that specifying it more explicitly, such as =--watch=config=, is necessary for it to work.

* Summary

Despite some unclear aspects, I‚Äôm satisfied with the setup for now. Xremap also has other interesting features, so I‚Äôd like to explore them at some point.
