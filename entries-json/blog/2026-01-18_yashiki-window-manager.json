Specifically, I ran into the limitation that AeroSpace doesn't expose layout information. I reached the conclusion that no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't completely build what I wanted with that approach.</p>\n<p>But I thought I had no other choice. Honestly, I figured writing a Window Manager from scratch was impossible for a weekend developer.\nHowever, my fate was sealed when I started coding with a coding agent just for a bit of fun while having a drink this weekend.</p>\n<p>Surprisingly, 6 hours later, I had something reasonably working. That made it incredibly fun, so I continued developing through the weekend. It has now reached a level where it's not just \"minimum viable,\" but a decently fully-featured window manager. Here it is:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/typester/yashiki\">typester/yashiki: macOS tiling window manager</a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3>A macOS Window Manager with the Awesome/River philosophy</h3>\n<p>Yashiki (that's the name of the WM I'm building) is, honestly, a hardcore WM. It has no mouse operations. It probably won't resonate with most people using macOS.</p>\n<p>However, if you are a former Linux user familiar with WMs like awesome or river, this WM is for you.\nRiver users, in particular, will feel a kinship. The command system, configuration method, and the decision to keep the layout engine external via plugins are all influenced by river.</p>\n<p>I am a long-time Awesome user and a die-hard Linux user who has loved River in recent years. For unavoidable reasons, I have to use macOS, so I am writing this software to make this environment as close as possible to the one I'm used to. There might not be many, but surely there are others like me. I hope this helps them.</p>\n<p>Conversely, I also recommend this to people interested in Linux desktops.</p>\n<p>If you can use Yashiki, you will definitely be able to use river without any awkwardness immediately. In other words, you can get a feel for the Linux desktop while using macOS.</p>\n<h3>Where to start</h3>\n<p>I worked reasonably hard on a <a href=\"https://github.com/typester/yashiki/blob/main/docs/quick-start.md\">Quick Start document</a>, so please refer to that first.</p>\n<p>For the concept of \"Tags,\" <a href=\"https://codeberg.org/river/wiki-classic/src/branch/main/pages/How-tags-work.md\">the river documentation</a> is also helpful, so take a look.</p>\n<h3>I want to collect Workarounds</h3>\n<p>Unfortunately, macOS WMs cannot avoid workarounds for apps that behave strangely.</p>\n<p>For example, Firefox generates mysterious windows (popup menus or something), which causes terrible flickering if used normally.\nThe current workaround for that is adding the following settings:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"shell\">yashiki rule-add --app-id org.mozilla.firefox --subrole AXUnknown ignore\nyashiki rule-add --app-id org.mozilla.firefox --title <span class=\"string\">\"\"</span> float</code></pre>\n\n<p>To allow creating many such workarounds, the rule settings are insanely robust.<a class=\"footref\" href=\"#fn1\" id=\"r1\">[1]</a>\nIf there are any adventurous souls using this WM, please teach me the workarounds you've configured via issues or pull requests. Based on that, I want to flesh out a workaround page.</p>\n<h3>Future Prospects</h3>\n<p>Actually, I use tiling window managers very simply, so it's no exaggeration to say that almost all the functions I need are already implemented.\nHowever, since I designed the layout to be freely extensible, I also want to try making various other layouts.</p>\n<p>If you have any requests, please head to the issues.</p>\n<p>Also, the layout engine is open for anyone to create, so if you are interested, check out <a href=\"https://github.com/typester/yashiki/blob/main/docs/layout-engine.md\">the docs</a>.</p>\n<p>See ya.</p>\n<aside class=\"footdef\">\n<p id=\"fn1\"><a href=\"#r1\">[1]</a> I mean, river users, seeing this syntax makes you feel right at home, doesn't it? 😎</p>\n</aside>\n"}
